# Spotify Listening History
Spotify Listening History is a tool that archives your Spotify listening activity and creates monthly playlists with tracks you listened to.

## Why?
- Revisit your favorite tracks from different months
- Track your music taste over time
- Automatic archiving and playlist creation

I've been doing this for myself for several years now and wanted to share such a process with others.
